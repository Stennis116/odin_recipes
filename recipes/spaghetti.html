<h2>Description</h2>
<P>Mom's spaghetti Bolognese recipe was passed on from my Italian grandfather. The ultimate comfort food. Leftovers freeze nicely! To make this recipe more authentic, you can use a mixture of ground veal, pork, and beef. You can also substitute 1/2 cup of red wine for the balsamic vinegar.</P>
<H2>Ingredients</H2>
<Ul>
<li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>3 strips bacon, diced</li>
<li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 stalk celery, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
<li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>2 (28 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes</li>
<li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
<li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
<li>Â¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</Ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in spaghetti and return to a boil. Cook spaghetti uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.</p>
<p>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; add bacon. Cook, turning occasionally, until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Add onion, celery, carrot, and oregano to bacon; continue cooking until vegetables begin to soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Crumble in ground beef; cook and stir until no longer pink and completely cooked, 8 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Pour vinegar over ground beef mixture; simmer until liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar; bring to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, then remove from heat. Stir in basil .</p>
<p>Spoon sauce over spaghetti; top with Parmesan cheese to serve.</p>
